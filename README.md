# Fruits-classification-using-ML

In this project, we develop a machine learning algorithm to recognize 29 types of fruits we used to eat.

We use the platform Teachable machine learning to develop our model, after that we download the .tflite file of our model.

We deploy our model in an Android app using Android studio.

All the files you will need to reproduce the project are in this folder.
